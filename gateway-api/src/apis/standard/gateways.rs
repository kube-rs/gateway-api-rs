    /// can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
    /// Listener fields.
    ///
    ///
    /// For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
    ///
    ///
    /// 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
    ///    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
    /// 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or

    ///    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
    ///
    ///
    /// Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
    /// whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
    /// for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
    ///
    ///
    /// When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
    /// Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
    /// Listener to be distinct.
    ///
    ///
    /// When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
    /// hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
    /// values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
    ///
    ///
    /// Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
    /// matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
    /// matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
    /// `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
    ///
    ///
    /// Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
    /// wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
    /// For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
    /// The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
    /// hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
    ///
    ///
    /// The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
    /// the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
    /// `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
    ///
    ///
    /// If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
    /// Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
    /// condition in the Listener Status to "True".
    ///

    /// accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
    /// Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
    /// This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
    /// Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
    /// least one Listener must be present.
    ///
    ///
    /// The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
    /// Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
    /// not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
    /// indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
    /// Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
