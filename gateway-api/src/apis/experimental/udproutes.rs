    /// allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
    /// the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
    /// namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
    /// namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
    /// and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
    /// not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
    /// create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
    /// Route.
    ///
    /// There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
    ///
    /// * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
    /// * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
    ///
    /// This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
    /// resources.
    ///
    /// ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
    ///
    /// * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
    ///   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
    ///   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
    ///   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
    /// * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
    ///   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
    ///   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
    ///   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
    ///
    /// Some examples:
    ///
    /// * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
    ///   same object must also set `sectionName`.
    /// * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
    ///   object must also set `port`.
    /// * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
    ///   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
    ///
    /// It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
    /// be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
    /// choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
    /// case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
    /// merged.
    ///
    /// Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
    /// rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
    /// allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
    /// Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
    /// generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
    ///
    ///
    /// ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
    /// routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
    /// any namespace to the Service.
    ///
    /// ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
    /// "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
    /// connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
    /// the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
    /// ParentRef of the Route.
