> **Warning**: EXPERIMENTAL. **Not ready for production use**.

> **Note**: While the aspiration is to eventually become the "official" Gateway
> API bindings for Rust, [Kubernetes SIG Network] has not yet (and may never)
> officially endorsed it so this should be considered "unofficial" for now.

# Gateway API (Rust)

> **Note**: Currently supports [Gateway API version v1.4.0][gwv]

This project provides bindings in [Rust] for [Kubernetes] [Gateway API].

[gwv]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.4.0
[Rust]:https://rust-lang.org
[Kubernetes]:https://kubernetes.io/
[Gateway API]:https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/

## Usage

Basic usage involves using a [kube-rs] [Client] to perform create, read, update
and delete (CRUD) operations on [Gateway API resources]. You can either use a
basic `Client` to perform CRUD operations, or you can build a [Controller]. See
the `gateway-api/examples/` directory for detailed (and specific) usage examples.

[Client]:https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Client.html
[Controller]:https://kube.rs/controllers/intro/

## Development

This project uses [Kopium] to automatically generate API bindings from upstream
Gateway API. Make sure you install `kopium` locally in order to run the
generator:

```console
$ cargo install kopium --version 0.21.1
```

After which you can run the `update.sh` script:

```console
$ ./update.sh
```

Check for errors and/or a non-zero exit code, but upon success you should see
updates automatically generated for code in the `gateway-api/src/api` directory
which you can then commit.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, and appreciated! In general (for larger changes)
please create an issue describing the contribution needed prior to creating a
PR.

If you're looking for something to do, we organize the work for this project
with a [project board][board], please check out the `next` column for
unassigned tasks as these are the things prioritized to be worked on in the
immediate.

For development support we do have an org-wide [#kube channel on the Tokio
Discord server][discord], but please note that for this project in particular we
prefer questions be posted in the [discussions board][forum].
